There is a critical need in the neuroimaging literature for open code and data sharing and convergence on accepted methods to increase scientific reliability. Because of this, over the past 5 years Dr. Hillary’s work has shifted to focus on the reproducibility of neuroimaging work in the study of brain disorders.

Since most researchers have limited time to perfect their workflows, this workshop introduces ‘good enough’ data practices; simple, time-efficient strategies that lay the groundwork for sharing, publishing, and reusing data. You’ll learn how to organize your files using logical directory structures and naming conventions, keep your data tidy and consistent, track changes with version control, and create basic metadata to describe your dataset. By the end of the session, you’ll be equipped with practical tools to make your data easier to manage now and far easier to share later. This is the first of three workshops on Getting Credit for Sharing Your Data.\nPresenter: Alaina Pearce\nPrerequisites: None\nSkill level: Novice\n\n\n\nWorkshop Session 2\n\nQuarto (Part I): A tool for open scholarship\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. As the Quarto site suggests, if you have a story to tell with data, you can tell it with Quarto. This workshop will introduce Quarto and show how it can a powerful tool for implementing open scholarship practices. This is the first of three workshops on Quarto.\nPresenter: Rick Gilmore\nPrerequisites: None\nSkill level: Novice\n\n\nQuestionable research practices\nWhat are questionable research practices?

To make data truly reusable, others must be able to find, access, and understand it. This workshop will guide participants through selecting an appropriate data repository and implementing best practices for documenting data with clear, well-structured metadata. We’ll discuss what to consider when choosing a repository, highlighting platforms such as ScholarSphere, Dataverse, the Open Science Framework (OSF), and Databrary. Just as important as where you share your data is how you document it. Metadata provides the essential context—the who, what, when, where, why, and how—that enables others to interpret and build upon your work. We will focus on two essential tools: README files and data dictionaries. By the end of the session, you’ll have the knowledge to identify repository features that meet your needs and the skills to create metadata that supports transparency, reproducibility, and meaningful reuse. This is the second of three workshops on Getting Credit for Sharing Your Data.\nPresenter: Alaiana Pearce\nPrerequisites: None\nSkill level: Novice\n\n\nQuarto (Part II): Reproducible research reports\nPresenters: John West and Rick Gilmore\nPrerequisites: Quarto (Part I) or equivalent\nSkill level: Advanced beginner\n\n\n\nWorkshop Session 4\n\nGetting credit for sharing your data (Part III): Data papers\nSharing data openly is a growing expectation in research but getting formal recognition for the time and effort involved is still a challenge. This workshop introduces one impactful way to gain academic credit for your data: publishing a data paper. Data papers are peer-reviewed journal articles that describe a dataset in detail—how it was collected, its structure, and its potential value for reuse. Data papers can be particularly helpful for researchers as they will: 1) add a peer-reviewed publication to your CV; 2) increase the visibility and usability of your dataset; and 3) provide a way for others to cite your data that will contribute to your citation count. In this hands-on session, we will explore the structure and purpose of data papers, walk through examples, and begin drafting key components based on your own projects. This is the third of three workshops on Getting Credit for Sharing Your Data.\nPresenter: Alaina Pearce\n\n\nLLMs with Jupyter notebooks\nPresenter: Valerie Li",
