There is a critical need in the neuroimaging literature for open code and data sharing and convergence on accepted methods to increase scientific reliability. Because of this, over the past 5 years Dr. Hillary’s work has shifted to focus on the reproducibility of neuroimaging work in the study of brain disorders.

She has done pioneering work on the statistical analysis of cognitive neuroscience data, with a focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Most recently, Lazar has been involved in the application of topological data analysis methods to scientific questions of interest in psychology and climatology.

Learn how to leverage the Roar supercomputing system—featuring high-performance CPU and GPU capabilities, scalable storage, and support for data-intensive research. Whether you’re running complex simulations, processing large datasets, or developing sophisticated workflows, Roar provides flexible solutions tailored to researchers across all disciplines. This session will cover both interactive, user-friendly interfaces and batch computing workflows to help you get started, regardless of your technical background.\nPresenter: Carrie Brown\nPrerequisites: Attendees will need an active Roar account. To request Roar access, please complete the Account Request form by Tuesday, August 12, 2025.\nSkill level: All\nLocation: W211A Pattee\n\n\n\nGetting credit for sharing your data (Part I): Good enough data practices\nEffective data management is key to research integrity, reproducibility, and making your data useful beyond your own project. Since most researchers have limited time to perfect their workflows, this workshop introduces ‘good enough’ data practices; simple, time-efficient strategies that lay the groundwork for sharing, publishing, and reusing data. You’ll learn how to organize your files using logical directory structures and naming conventions, keep your data tidy and consistent, track changes with version control, and create basic metadata to describe your dataset. By the end of the session, you’ll be equipped with practical tools to make your data easier to manage now and far easier to share later. This is the first of three workshops on Getting Credit for Sharing Your Data.\nPresenter: Alaina Pearce\nPrerequisites: None\nSkill level: Novice\nLocation: Dewey Room\nResources:\n\nSlides pdf, pptx\nDirectory naming worksheet docx\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop Session 2\n\nGetting started with Python in JupyterLab: A hands-on introduction\nCurious about Python and how to get started with coding? Join us for a one-hour, hands-on workshop introducing Python programming using JupyterLab. Designed for beginners, this session will guide you through the basics of Python using interactive example notebooks. You’ll gain experience navigating the JupyterLab environment while working through live code, and you’ll leave with a set of curated notebooks you can continue exploring on your own. No prior programming experience required!\nPresenter: Carrie Brown\nPrerequisites: Attendees will need an active Roar account. To request Roar access, please complete the Account Request form by Tuesday, August 12, 2025.\nSkill level: Novice\nLocation: W211A Pattee\n\n\n\nQuestionable research practices\nWhat are questionable research practices?

As the Quarto site suggests, if you have a story to tell with data, you can tell it with Quarto. This workshop will introduce Quarto and show how it can be a powerful tool for implementing open scholarship practices. This is the first of two workshops on Quarto.\nPresenter: Rick Gilmore\nPrerequisites: None, but if you plan to bring a laptop, please follow the instructions here to install R, RStudio, and Quarto.\nSkill level: Novice\nResources:\n\nHTML talk slides\nGitHub template repository\n\nLocation: W211A Pattee\n\n\n\nGetting credit for sharing your data (Part II): Sharing your data\nNew funder requirements call for researchers to share their data openly — but simply uploading data files isn’t enough. To make data truly reusable, others must be able to find, access, and understand it. This workshop will guide participants through selecting an appropriate data repository and implementing best practices for documenting data with clear, well-structured metadata. We’ll discuss what to consider when choosing a repository, highlighting platforms such as ScholarSphere, Dataverse, the Open Science Framework (OSF), and Databrary. Just as important as where you share your data is how you document it. Metadata provides the essential context—the who, what, when, where, why, and how—that enables others to interpret and build upon your work. We will focus on two essential tools: README files and data dictionaries. By the end of the session, you’ll have the knowledge to identify repository features that meet your needs and the skills to create metadata that supports transparency, reproducibility, and meaningful reuse. This is the second of three workshops on Getting Credit for Sharing Your Data.\nPresenter: Alaina Pearce\nPrerequisites: None\nSkill level: Novice\nLocation: Dewey Room\nResources:\n\nSlides pdf, pptx\nSample data README MD, txt\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop Session 4\n\nLLMs with Jupyter notebooks\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming the way we work with text data. This hands-on workshop introduces the basics of text-as-data, including word embeddings and zero-shot learning, and demonstrates how to deploy a free, open-access LLM using Hugging Face in a Jupyter Notebook. Participants will follow a guided example of sentiment analysis to explore how LLMs can be used for real-world tasks. After the workshop, you will receive a set of curated notebooks to further explore LLMs and their functionalities on your own.\nSkill level: Intermediate\nPresenter: Valerie Li\nPrerequisites: Day 1 workshop - Getting started with Python in JupyterLab: A hands-on introduction (preferred but not required); A Google account (to be able to access the free Google Colab environment).\nSkill level: Intermediate\nLocation: W211A Pattee\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRight-click on the link below to download the file to your computer.\n\n\n\nTutorial Jupyter notebook (ipynb)\n\n\n\n\nGetting credit for sharing your data (Part III): Data papers\nSharing data openly is a growing expectation in research but getting formal recognition for the time and effort involved is still a challenge. This workshop introduces one impactful way to gain academic credit for your data: publishing a data paper. Data papers are peer-reviewed journal articles that describe a dataset in detail—how it was collected, its structure, and its potential value for reuse. Data papers can be particularly helpful for researchers as they will: 1) add a peer-reviewed publication to your CV; 2) increase the visibility and usability of your dataset; and 3) provide a way for others to cite your data that will contribute to your citation count. In this hands-on session, we will explore the structure and purpose of data papers, walk through examples, and begin drafting key components based on your own projects. This is the third of three workshops on Getting Credit for Sharing Your Data.\nPresenter: Alaina Pearce\nLocation: Dewey Room\nResources:\n\nChecklist pdf\nWorksheet docx",
