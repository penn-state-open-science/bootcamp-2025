## (Optional) Install git

The version control package git may not be installed on your Windows machine. It is usually installed by default on Mac OS.

If git is not installed, visit <https://git-scm.com/downloads>, download, and install it for your operating system.

You can use R, RStudio, and Quarto without using git, but there are good reasons to consider using it.

If you decide to use the web-based git code sharing service called [GitHub](https://github.com) with RStudio, you will want to follow the excellent instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com).
