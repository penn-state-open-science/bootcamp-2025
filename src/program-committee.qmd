Frank G. Hillary is a Professor of [Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and [Neurology](https://med.psu.edu/neurology) at Penn State. His research examines the influence of brain injury and disease on functional brain organization over the lifespan.  To do so, he incorporates cognitive testing, structural and functional MRI, and network neuroscience approaches (e.g., graph theory) in his work. There is a critical need in the neuroimaging literature for open code and data sharing and convergence on accepted methods to increase scientific reliability. Because of this, over the past 5 years Dr. Hillary's work has shifted to focus on the reproducibility of neuroimaging work in the study of brain disorders. He is the leader of an international working group, ENIGMA Brain Injury (see: https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-tbi/), focused on genetics and neuroimaging data sharing and reproducible science.

Nicole Lazar is Professor and Head of the Department of [Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) at Penn State. Her research interests include the foundations of statistical inference and the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. In particular, she has worked on fundamental inferential topics such as model selection, multiple testing problems, and likelihood theory, specifically in the context of modern large-scale data analysis problems. She has done pioneering work on the statistical analysis of cognitive neuroscience data, with a focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Most recently, Lazar has been involved in the application of topological data analysis methods to scientific questions of interest in psychology and climatology. These techniques are at the interface of statistics, mathematics, and computer science, and exemplify her cross-disciplinary approach to research. Lazar is the author of the book *The Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data* published by Springer. Nicole is the Open Science Liaison for the NSF-funded [National Synthesis Center for Emergence in the Molecular and Cellular Sciences (NCEMS)](https://ncems.psu.edu), based at Penn State.
<!-- Lazar is also Co-PI on an NSF-funded project on fostering open science education for graduate students [NSF-1955049](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1955049) which has led to the formation of the [Open Science Alliance](https://openscialliance.github.io/). -->
